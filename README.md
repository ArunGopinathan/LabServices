# Lab Services

This repository contains samples extending and improving the Azure Lab Services August 2022 update experience.  The goal is to have a place where everyone can find new and different ways to improve their experience with Lab Services and contribute\improve existing samples.  We will be migrating over existing code from the [Azure-DevTestLab repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-devtestlab/tree/master/samples/ClassroomLabs) depending on need.  If there is something that you want, feel free to create an issue.

## Overview
Below is different overarching areas that we have different samples.
 
### General Scripts
These are scripts to help either tangentially to Lab Services or in support of Lab Services.

### Lab Management
This code is to help with Lab Management:
- Creating labs at scale.
- Customizing labs, templates, or VMs.
- Managing students, schedules, or roles at scale.
